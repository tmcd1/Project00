  This is a synopsis of the explanation Paul Zietz gives in Chapter 1 of his
  book [[https://www.wiley.com/en-us/The+Art+and+Craft+of+Problem+Solving%252C+3rd+Edition-p-9781119094845][The Art and Craft of Problem Solving]], wherein he seeks to clearly answer
  these and related questions:

  What does problem solving mean?

  Why should you study it?

  What is the difference between exercises and problems?

  *An exercise* is a mathematical question that you immediately know how to
  answer. You may not answer it correctly, or it may be nearly impossible to
  answer, but there is no doubt about how to proceed.

  *A problem* is a question that you initially don\rsquo{}t know how to answer. One
  person\rsquo{}s problem may be another person\rsquo{}s exercise. Problems require
  investigation, using strategies and tactics.

  Work on problems to develop mental discipline.

  Brain exercises like crossword puzzles or Sudoku puzzles are not without
  merit, but they miss a crucial aspect of your intellectual life. Our brains
  can help us with open-ended experimentation, involving long wild goose chases
  and hard-earned triumph. We need brain problems.

  Exercisers are gym rats, problem solvers are mountaineers. Climbing a mountain
  is a messier experience, but it is much more fun.

  Exercise: Learning Italian from a book.

  Problem: Learning Italian by immersion.

  Problem solving should be a way of life.

  There are psychological barriers to problem solving.

  Learning to become a problem solver requires a change in mental attitudes.

  Most of us are not used to thinking hard for a few seconds or a minute.

  Work on increasing your levels.

** Levels in seconds (roughly)

   - 10^0 Second
   - 10^1 Minute
   - 10^3 Hour
   - 10^5 Day
   - 10^6 Week
   - 10^7 Year
   - 10^9 Lifetime

   We will fail in problem solving. We need to cultivate an attitude that
   investigation is worthwhile even if it doesn\rsquo{}t lead to a solution.

** Strategies and Tactics

   Strategy: Wishful Thinking. Yay, I\rsquo{}ve solved the problem! Pretend you\rsquo{}ve got
   a solution. This helps you learn the penultimate step.

   Strategy: Get Your Hands Dirty (Concretize The Abstract)

   Tactic: Symmetry.

   A problem is a problem because we needed more information. When you
   balance your problem, you get more information.
