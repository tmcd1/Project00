  PVP the result of evaluating the following (paying special attention to the
  more-than-syntactic difference between the \lsquo{}starless\rsquo{} form of =let= and the
  \lsquo{}star-suffixed\rsquo{} form):

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (let ((a 1) (b 2) (c 3)) (+ a b c))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 6

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (let ((a 1) (b 2) (c 3)) (+ a b c d))
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (let ((a 1) (b 2) (c 3)) [+ a b c d])
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: [+ a b c d]

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (let ((a 1) (b 2) (c 3) (+ 4)) (+ a b c +))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 10

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (makunbound 'a)
  (let ((a 1) (b 2) (c 3) (d (+ a 4))) (+ a b c d))
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (let* ((a 1) (b 2) (c 3) (d (+ a 4))) (+ a b c d))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

  1. It seems that the =let= function assigns multiple variables at the same time, then lets us perform an operation
     using the assigned variables without modifying the variable values.
  2. I think that it will return an invalid number, because d isn't defined.
     After running the second block, my hypothesis was correct. It wouldn't run the block because the symbol value for d was void.
  3. I think that the same thing will happen as in example 2, but it might be different because we are performing the operation
     on a vector, and not a list.
     I guess because we used the square brackets, the regular expression [+ a b c d] is returned. (I learned that the [] in elisp is a
     'character alternative' after I googled it.
  4. I think that the symbol '+' will be run as a 4 at the end of the list, but will be interpreted correctly when at the front of the list.
     I was right! Taht dsoen't hpaepn vrey otefn.
  5. I guess the =makeunbound= function makes 'a' mutable, so the last input to =let= should be equated to 5, which means the the entire
     function will return 11.
     I don't really know what happened, but I think that the =makeunbound= function voided the symbol 'a'.
  6. Does the * return a pointer to the value??
     After some research, I found the =let*= evaluates each expression one-at-a-time, creating a location for each. This means that 'd' can be
     evaluated just fine, and the rest of the expression can be valid.

  A function-as-association between elements of a domain and elements of a
  codomain, for \ldquo{}small\rdquo domains and codomains, inspired so-called \ldquo{}association
  lists\rdquo (or alists) and the =assoc= (and associated) functions.

  =(assoc KEY LIST)= returns non-nil if KEY is \ldquo{}equal\rdquo to the first element of
  an element of LIST. The value is actually the first element of LIST whose
  first element equals KEY.

  For example, here is a function that uses an alist to look up the RGB values
  of a given color name:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :results silent
  (defun lookup-rgb (color-name)
    (rest (assoc color-name
                 '(("red" 255 0 0) ("green" 0 255 0) ("blue" 0 0 255)))))
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :results raw
  (lookup-rgb "blue")
#+END_SRC

: (0 0 255)

  What if the color name is not in the alist?

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :results raw
  (lookup-rgb "grue")
#+END_SRC

: nil

  There are several variations of =assoc=. Find and give examples of using them.

*** Your answer goes here.
    =(rassoc VALUE LIST)= returns non-nill if VALUE matches the value of an element in LIST
    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :results silent
  (defun find-values (value)
    (rest (rassoc value '((a . 3) (b . 4) (c . 5)))))
    #+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (find-values (4))
#+END_SRC

** TODO WFK
  In the function-as-map context, here is another interpretation:

  A \ldquo{}map\rdquo type (AKA associative array, AKA hashtable) is found in many
  languages. For example, C++:
#+BEGIN_SRC C++ :results output
  #include <iostream>
  #include <map>
  using namespace std;

  int main() {
     map<string, string> mymap;

     mymap["one"] = "red";
     mymap["two"] = "blue";
     mymap["three"] = "green";

     for (auto const &ent1 : mymap) {
        cout << ent1.first << " : " << ent1.second << endl;
     }
  }
#+END_SRC

: one : red
: three : green
: two : blue

  And python:
#+BEGIN_SRC python :results output
  mymap = {}

  mymap["one"] = "red"
  mymap["two"] = "blue"
  mymap["three"] = "green"

  if __name__ == "__main__":
          for key in mymap.keys():
                  print key + " : " + str(mymap[key])
#+END_SRC

: three : green
: two : blue
: one : red

  And of course elisp:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :results output
  (let* ((mymap (make-hash-table :test 'equal)))
    (puthash "one" "red" mymap)
    (puthash "two" "blue" mymap)
    (puthash "three" "green" mymap)
    (pp (list (gethash "one" mymap)
              (gethash "two" mymap)
              (gethash "three" mymap)))
    (maphash (lambda (key value) (princ (format "%s : %s\n" key value))) mymap))
#+END_SRC

: ("red" "blue" "green")
: one : red
: two : blue
: three : green

  What happens if you omit the =:test 'equal= parameters to the
  =make-hash-table= call?

** TODO TER
  This exercise explores /looping/ versus /mapping/.

  What does the =morphify= function defined below do? Think about it, then PVP
  the result of the call to it that follows.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :results silent
  (defun morphify (fun lst)
    (loop for item in lst
          collect (funcall fun item)))
#+END_SRC

  Note the quotes:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :results raw
  (morphify (quote downcase) (quote ("THIS" "IS" "TOO" "LOUD")))
#+END_SRC

  The =morphify= function is essentially a /mapping/ function, which means it
  takes a passed-in function (=fun=) and a passed-in list (=lst=), and /maps fun
  over lst/, i.e., the results of calling the function =fun= on each element of
  the list =lst= are collected into a new list, which is returned.

  This shows one way (iteratively) a /map/ function could be implemented.
  Another way is /recursively/, as in:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :results silent
  (defun morphifyr (fun lst)
    (if (null lst)
        nil
      (append (list (funcall fun (first lst))) (morphifyr fun (rest lst)))))
#+END_SRC

  Explain how this version of =morphify= works.

** TODO TGE
  Note the difference if -13 is used instead of 13 below:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :results silent
  (defun compute-floor-the-hard-way (dividend divisor)
    (- (/ dividend (float divisor)) (/ (mod dividend divisor) (float divisor))))
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :results raw
  (let* ((number (/ 13 4.0))
         (floor1 (floor number))
         (floor2 (compute-floor-the-hard-way 13 4.0)))
    (list number floor1 floor2))
#+END_SRC

: (3.25 3 3.0)

  Is the hard way correct?

  Graph the floor and ceiling functions f(x) = \lfloor{}x\rfloor and f(x) = \lceil{}x\rceil for real
  number values of x in the interval [-5.0 .. 5.0].

*** Your answer goes here.
** TODO WKM
  Which of these statements about floor and ceiling are correct, for any real
  number $x$ and any integers $n$ and $m$?
  1. $x - 1 < \lfloor{}x\rfloor \le x \le \lceil{}x\rceil < x + 1$.
  2. $\lfloor{}-x\rfloor = -\lceil{}x\rceil$.
  3. $\lceil{}-x\rceil = -\lfloor{}x\rfloor$.
  4. $\lfloor{}x + n\rfloor = \lfloor{}x\rfloor + n$.
  5. $\lceil{}x + n\rceil = \lceil{}x\rceil + n$.
  6. $\lfloor{}\frac{n}{2}\rfloor + \lceil{}\frac{n}{2}\rceil = n$.
  7. $\lfloor{}\frac{n}{2}\rfloor + \lfloor{}\frac{n + 1}{2}\rfloor = n$.
  8. $\lceil{}\frac{n}{2}\rceil + \lceil{}\frac{n + 1}{2}\rceil = n$.
  9. $\lfloor{}\frac{n + m}{2}\rfloor + \lceil{}\frac{n - m + 1}{2}\rceil = n$ (for any $m$, not just $m =
     0$ as in statement 7).
  10. $\lceil{}\frac{n + m}{2}\rceil + \lceil{}\frac{n - m + 1}{2}\rceil = n$ (for any $m$, not just $m =
      0$ as in statement 8).

** TODO TIW

  Define the function \ldquo{}round to nearest integer\rdquo using the floor and ceiling
  functions, together with the \ldquo{}Iverson bracket\rdquo function. (A number whose
  fractional part is less than one-half should be rounded down, otherwise up.)
